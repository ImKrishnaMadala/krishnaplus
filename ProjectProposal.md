# 1.The Big Idea: 

#### The main idea of our project is to create a web application that asks users for a series of inputs and recommends a drink to make (with instructions included). Our mission is to give users the tools to discover interesting drinks and make them so they can enjoy themselves and impress their company. We will explore the topics of building a database, engaging with a user, and building a visually appealing front end website. Our minimum viable product will be a basic website that asks the user for a series of inputs, such as tolerance, taste preferences, mood/vibe, social setting, etc. We would then return a picture of the drink with step by step instructions on how to make it. A stretch goal is to make the website more dynamic and engaging. It would also be great to enrich our data set by adding affiliate links showing the user where they can buy all the ingredients needed for the drink.


# 2.Learning Goals

#### Our shared learning goal is to become better at python and learn libraries/frameworks such as Flask. We also want to become better at writing software in a team setting. Sumer specifically wants to become better at using Github and the software design component of this project. Krishna and Isha have more of a focus on understanding how to implement the project from a technical standpoint. (Data structures, frameworks, UX/UI).

# 3.Implementation Plan:

# 4.Project Schedule:

# 5.Collaboration Plan:

#### We plan to split up our milestones by week per person. As a result each person will be responsible for their own work during the week but we will conduct bi-weekly code reviews where we revise our code together and get through roadblocks anyone encountered during the week. We believe this is the best methodology so far since this is a learning project we want to give every member time to figure out their relevant tasks on their own while also allowing everyone to gain more holistic experience from the project through the bi-weekly reviews. In addition we will experiment in the task distribution with kanban boards in order to make task management more accountable and simple especially when identifying where roadblocks are located. To this end we will start our project by generating said kanban boards and modifying them as we go through the term and complete further tasks. 

# 6.Risks:

#### There are multiple risks to the success of this project one of the primary ones being that none of the current team members have any experience with flask or designing databases/ any data storage utilizing python. In addition we have to consider the algorithim design as there is no exact science to drink recommendations and presently we understand how to temper the equation to alcohol tolerance or preference of juice but beyond that the recommendations will take more understadning to flesh out.
