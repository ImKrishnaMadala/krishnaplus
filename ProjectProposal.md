# 2.Learning Goals

# 3.Implementation Plan:

# 4.Project Schedule:

# 5.Collaboration Plan:

#### We plan to split up our milestones by week per person. As a result each person will be responsible for their own work during the week but we will conduct bi-weekly code reviews where we revise our code together and get through roadblocks anyone encountered during the week. We believe this is the best methodology so far since this is a learning project we want to give every member time to figure out their relevant tasks on their own while also allowing everyone to gain more holistic experience from the project through the bi-weekly reviews. In addition we will experiment in the task distribution with kanban boards in order to make task management more accountable and simple especially when identifying where roadblocks are located. To this end we will start our project by generating said kanban boards and modifying them as we go through the term and complete further tasks. 

# 6.Risks:

#### There are multiple risks to the success of this project one of the primary ones being that none of the current team members have any experience with flask or designing databases/ any data storage utilizing python. In addition we have to consider the algorithim design as there is no exact science to drink recommendations and presently we understand how to temper the equation to alcohol tolerance or preference of juice but beyond that the recommendations will take more understadning to flesh out.
